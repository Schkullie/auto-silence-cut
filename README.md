- sometimes extra tracks are created when creating new timeline. No idea why this is happening but i think its a DR problem. It used to cause problems with coloring clips but that should be resolved now.

- there is a case where sometimes the output timeline will be slightly shorter than the original file by a frame or two. I believe this is something to do with the way auto-editor handles cuts.
